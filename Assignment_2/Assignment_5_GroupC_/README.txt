Assignment 5 Group C
Roberto Albanese

There are two versions of our assignment: 
- the first one is 'Assignment_5_GroupC' and implements obstacle avoidance using potential fields, but with a formula ideated by us, and works fine
  in numerous situations.
- the second one is 'Assignment_5_GroupC_algorithm' and implements obstacle avoidance using potential fields with the formula on the slides, but it 
  doesn't always work and has some problems, for example when the area of the potential field activation of the obstacle  contains the goal position, 
  the robot continues to rotate around the goal without reaching it, or when the obstacle is exactly on the same line of the robot and the goal, some
  strange behaviours occur.
